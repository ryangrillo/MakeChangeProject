## Ryan's Make Change Homework Project

This is my week 1 graded homework.

Make Change (Cash Register)

The program will ask for input of the price of an item

The user needs to type in an input.  

After this, the computer will ask if you entered the right amount. Answer (Y/N)

The program will then ask for input for the amount tendered follwed by
a check to see if the right amount was entered, Answer (Y/N).

if the amount tendered is too low, the program will give an error message and start over;

if the tendered amount is equal to the price it will state "no change due"

Otherwise the computer will output the amount of change due and tell you all
of the correct denominations.
